/**
 * <h2>The manager</h2>
 * 
 * This is a size-aware, highly concurrent and lock free deque manager that
 * provides a key-based abstraction/view into many deques.<p>
 * 
 * The deques are mapped with a key known by the client.<p>
 * 
 * The amount of deques grow and shrink dynamically on demand. They grow (a
 * deque is added) whenever an element is added when there was no previous
 * mapping of the key to a deque, and the amount of deques shrinks (a deque is
 * removed) whenever an element of a deque is removed such that the mapped deque
 * becomes empty. This process is completely transparent for the client. All he
 * cares about is the key and the element that the client want to put in a deque
 * or have removed from one.<p>
 * 
 * Currently, there is no eviction policy implemented. What goes into a deque
 * stays there (strongly referenced) until explicitly removed by the client.<p>
 * 
 * Scroll to the bottom of this JavaDoc for some code examples.<p>
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>Position aware elements</h2>
 * 
 * The manager can notify each element of the element's position in the deque as
 * it changes if the element implements {@linkplain PositionAware}
 * <strong>and</strong> if a {@linkplain ExecutorService} was provided to one of
 * constructors.<p>
 * 
 * It is safe to mix {@code PositionAware} elements with "regular" elements that
 * do not implement the interface.<p>
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>Weakly consistent</h2>
 * 
 * The information received from {@linkplain #sizeOf(Object)} and position
 * changes that is reported to position-aware elements is only <i>weakly
 * consistent</i>. In English, that means that the value of a reported size-
 * or position does not have to be timely and up-to-date. Another descriptive
 * terminology would be "best-effort basis". For example, there is no guarantee
 * that a position-aware element is reported to have position {@code 1} even
 * though the element at some point in time have that position.<p>
 * 
 * Therefore, client code must only use this type of information for reporting
 * and generation of statistics, or any other type of application that does not
 * require precise information. Displaying this information for a human user in
 * his GUI window what position he has could be one example of a good use.
 * Making a pacemaker depend on the information would not be that great.<p>
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>Cost and distribution of workload</h2>
 * 
 * The cost of querying the size of a queue is not O(1) ("constant" time
 * expressed in Big-O notation), or in English; is not as cheap or predictable
 * as reading a <code>long</code> variable neatly stuffed away somewhere. In
 * fact, a call to {@linkplain #sizeOf(Object)} will probably involve some
 * computation of adding together a minor set of counters into one aggregated
 * sum. But the computation is expected to be fast enough for most applications
 * to not bother. Under the hood, the size of each managed deque is tracked by a
 * {@linkplain LongAdder}.<p>
 * 
 * A not as fast operation is the reporting of position changes to all position-
 * aware elements in a deque that became the target of a structural modification.
 * Therefore, the {@code ConcurrentDequeManager} will run these jobs
 * asynchronously using an {@code ExecutorService} that you must provide to a
 * constructor, or forfeit the feature all together. We simply cannot risk to
 * block the client's execution path while his thread spins of trying to report
 * five billion new positions (all being the result of a simple add or remove!).
 * This behavior has two implications you should be aware of:
 * 
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Client code that operate the manager can do business as usual and always expect really fast implementations.</li>
 *   <li>Client code that is executed as a result of using position-aware elements, should not thread off but instead block.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * Why number 2? The thread that execute the client's callback come straight
 * from a thread pool. In worst case scenario, if the client's code does not
 * block but instead create new asynchronous tasks on each callback, then this
 * could potentially lead to a memory leak. The memory leak will only happen if
 * the system cannot cope with the amount of continuous new task creation. At
 * best, a low-level {@code RejectedExecutionException} will be thrown. The
 * callback is supposed to be a quick job, so let the worker thread complete his
 * job before he moves on to report the position of the next position-aware
 * element.<p>
 * 
 * The executor service is not only used to report position status changes. Some
 * maintenance work and the work of removing an element that we don't know the
 * position of, will be executed asynchronously too. Well, only if you provide
 * an executor service that is. Otherwise, these tasks are forced to be executed
 * on the client's thread.<p>
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>Time accuracy</h2>
 * 
 * It's worth writing a note about one more detail. The position of elements and
 * the size of each deque is by no means guaranteed to see a continuous flow of
 * sequential information. The size of the queue will not steadily go from 1 to
 * 5 million. Nor will the last element's reported position be reported 5
 * million times down to 0. This is a design aware trade off chosen in order to
 * prioritize timely correct information more than having non-jagged reports
 * dragging behind schedule, hammering the CPU.<p>
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>TODO: USE CASES (I guess see the test files for now?)</h2>
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * @param <K> unique key that map to a deque. Required to override both
 *            {@code Object.hashCode()} and {@code Object.equals(Object)}

 * @param <E> element of each deque. Should preferably override {@code
 *            Object.equals(Object)} properly.
